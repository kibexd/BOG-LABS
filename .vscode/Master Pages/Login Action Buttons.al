// Welcome to the "Login Action Buttons" page, where the magic of user authentication happens! 
// This page is like the friendly doorman of a fancy club, checking if you're on the guest list 
// (a.k.a. if you have the right credentials) before letting you in to the exclusive world of your account.
// 
// Here, we have a button that serves as the gateway for users to either log in to their existing accounts 
// or register for a brand new one. Think of it as a magical button that transforms based on your needs‚Äî
// if you're feeling like a seasoned member, it shouts "üîë Login!" but if you're a newbie ready to join the fun, 
// it cheerfully says "üìù Register!" 
//
// When you click this button, it doesn't just sit there; it springs into action, calling upon the "Sacco Login and Registration" page 
// to perform its duties. It's like a superhero, swooping in to save the day by handling your login or registration 
// with grace and style. 
//
// The layout is designed to be as user-friendly as a puppy in a room full of kittens, ensuring that even your grandma 
// could navigate it without breaking a sweat. So, buckle up and get ready to dive into the world of user actions, 
// where every click counts and every button has a purpose!
